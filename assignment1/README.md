- # **Task_1** :
  - ## Objective - Perform Basic Mathematical Operations.
    - Allow the user to enter two inputs as **num1** & **num2**.
    - Perform a check if entered inputs is indeed a valid number *{i.e. Integer in range -Infinity to Infinity}*.
    - If it's not valid, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
    - If the number is valid, perform basic mathematical operation *{i.e. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division}* and store them.
    - For divison of two numbers, if denominator is zero, it will raise a error that will be caught inside except block. 
    - Display the output with the values of basic operations.

- # **Task_2** :
  - ## Objective - Create a Personalized Greeting.
    - Allow the user to enter two inputs as **fname** & **lname**.
    - Check if both input are null *{i.e. no input was entered}*.
    - If null, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
    - If not null, concat two inputs into a single var **concat_name**
    - Display the concatinated input.
