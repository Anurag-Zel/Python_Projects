- # **Task_1** :
  - ## Objective - Calculate Factorial Using a Function.
    - Create a function **facotorial** that takes a single number as argument. This function will calculate the factorial given number.
    - Use reecursion to keep calculating factorial of a number, till it hits stop condition.
    - Allow user to enter an input.
    - Perform a check if entered input is indeed a valid number *{i.e. number >= 0}*.
    - If it's not valid, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
    - If the number is valid, calculate the factorial of number by calling the factorial function and passing the number as argument.
    - Display the output.

- # **Task_2** :
  - ## Objective - Using the Math Module for Calculations.
    - Allow the user to enter an input.
    - Perform a check if entered input is indeed a valid number *{i.e. number > 0}*.
    - If it's not valid, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
    - If the number is valid, import the *math* module to perform scientifc math operation like Square Root, Logarithm, Sine on the number.
    - Display the output.
