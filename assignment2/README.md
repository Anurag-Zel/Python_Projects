- # **Task_1** :
  - ## Objective - Check if a Number is Even or Odd.
    - Allow the user to enter an input.
    - Perform a check if entered input is indeed a valid number *{i.e. Integer in range -Infinity to Infinity}*.
    - If it's not valid, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
    - If the number is valid, check if the number is odd or even using the **modulus** operator *{i.e. if modulus of number by 2 is 0 then even, else odd}.*
    - Display the output.

- # **Task_2** :
  - ## Objective - Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop.
    - Initialize a variable **sum**, which will store the sum of all numbers.
    - Utilize the for loop in range from 1 till 51 *{as end is not inclusive}* to iterate over all numbers from 1 to till 50 *{inclusive}*.
    - Update the variable on each iteration, adding value of integer to self.
    - Print the output.
    - In case of any error, raise an expection which is caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
