- # **Task_1** :
  - ## Objective - Create a Dictionary of Student Marks.
    - Create a dictionary of students as **student_list**, with the student names as unique keys and student marks as value against the key. *{In Dictionary keys are unique so no two or more student can share the same name}*
    - Allow the user to input a student's name.

- # **Task_2** :
  - ## Objective - Demonstrate List Slicing.
    - Create a list **original_list**, with number from 1 to 10 *{inclusive}* in order.
    - Create a new list **extract_list** by slicing the first 5 elements from **original_list**, using the *slice* function of list.
    - Create another list **reverse_list** by reversing the order of numbers stored in **extract_list**. 
    - Import the *{copy}* module and create a deep copy of **extract_list**, by using *{copy.deepcopy(extract_list)}*.
    - Reverse the order of **reverse_list** by using *{reverse_list.reverse()}* function.
    - Display all three list as output.
    - For any exception, it will be caught in except block, avoiding any abdrupt termination of program.
